            donations made to social organisations by delivering products directly to them instead of giving money. We
            have added these unique features on our platform where transparency is given utmost importance.

            BD believes in need based donation and lists down the quantity of products that the organisations
            are in need of at that particular time. If any donations are made offline we canâ€™t track those details and
            NGO will end up getting products which they would have already received on BD. So we suggest
            donating products on BD and later visit the organisation once these are delivered.

              At BD the NGOâ€™s ask the donors for products instead of monetary donations. Thus the donor gets the maximum satisfaction for every single rupee they have spent on the product. This transparency in terms of the donation will drive the donors to our platform rather than other crowd-funding platforms/your website that ask money. Our ability to track their donations and the updates given by NGOs will also attract the donors. Many NGOs have seen 300% increase in the Donor base because of BD.
